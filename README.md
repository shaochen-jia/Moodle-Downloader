**Your unit's files, filed into week folders, by themselves, all semester.**
Lecture recordings become readable transcripts, so a week's material is text
you can search, skim, or paste into a chatbot.

> **Built for Monash University students.** It is written against Monash's
> Moodle, Panopto and single sign-on. Other universities are out of scope —
> the course structure it understands is Monash's custom one.

## What it actually does

You click once. From then on, this happens on its own:

| | What you get | Set-up needed |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 📂 **Files** | Every slide, worksheet, reading and solution, filed into `Week 00` – `Week 12` | none |
| 🕐 **Late files** | Tutorial solutions posted three days after class arrive by themselves | none |
| 📝 **Assignments** | Briefs and rubrics per assignment, plus an index of every assessment with due dates | none |
| 🎧 **Transcripts** | Lecture recordings turned into readable text — no video downloaded | none |
| 🗒️ **Weekly notes** | A `Week NN Summary` listing that week's files, recordings and what's due next | none |
| 🤖 **AI summaries** | A revision-ready summary on top of each transcript | one API key ([see below](#ai-summaries--optional)) |
| 🔒 **Your password** | Never seen by the app. Login happens on Monash's own page | none |

**Nothing is ever downloaded twice.** Delete a file by accident and it comes
back next sync. Move the app and your settings follow.

## What one sync does

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Wakes up<br/>logon + every 3h] --> B[Restores your<br/>saved session]
    B --> C[Crawls every<br/>section + subsection]
    C --> D{Seen this<br/>file before?}
    D -- no --> E[Download into<br/>the right week]
    D -- yes --> F[Skip]
    C --> G[Finds recordings<br/>4 ways staff post them]
    G --> H[Captions → text]
    H --> I[Week note<br/>+ optional AI summary]
    E --> I
```

It runs with no window and no notification. You only ever see it if your
Monash login genuinely expired.

## Getting started — Windows, nothing to install

1. **Download** `MoodleDownloader.exe` from [Releases](../../releases) and put
   it anywhere. Windows will warn about an unknown publisher — that is normal
   for free unsigned software. Choose **More info → Run anyway**.
2. **Open it**, pick where files should go, then click **Load my courses from
   Moodle**. Log in when the browser window appears, and tick
   **"Keep me signed in"** so this rarely happens again.
3. **Tick your units** → **Finish and run first sync**.
4. **Leave Auto-sync on.** That's it. New files arrive on their own.

> Your password is typed only into Monash's own login page. There is no
> server, no account, and no telemetry. Session cookies stay on your machine

## AI summaries — optional

**Everything above works with no API key and nothing sent anywhere.** Leave
this off and the feature does not appear at all.

### What a key buys you

1. **A summary on top of every transcript** — thorough enough to revise from,
   not a teaser. Every topic covered gets its own section.
2. **A fallback when YouTube blocks you.** YouTube rate-limits by IP address.
   When that happens, Gemini can read the video from Google's side instead —
   so the transcript still arrives.

### Which one to pick

| If you… | Choose | Why |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| just want it free | **Gemini** | Google's free tier is the most generous, and it is this tool's default |
| want nothing leaving your PC | **Ollama** | Runs locally. No key, no cost, no data ever leaves the machine |
| already pay for ChatGPT / Claude API | **OpenAI** / **Anthropic** | No new account to open |
| are on a mainland-China network | **DeepSeek**, **GLM**, **Qwen**, **Kimi** | Reachable without a VPN, and cheap |

Pick the provider and paste the key in the setup screen. Nothing else to configure.

### What it costs

Here is the honest arithmetic, so you can judge it yourself:

| | Typical semester |
| :-- | :-- |
| Units | 4 |
| Recordings transcribed | ~100 |
| API calls | ~100 (one per recording) |
| Tokens in | ~1,000,000 (a lecture transcript is ~9k tokens) |
| Tokens out | ~200,000 |

At Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite's published rate of **$0.10 per million input** and
**$0.40 per million output**, that works out to roughly **$0.20 for the whole
semester** — and on the free tier, nothing at all. The tool paces itself to
6 seconds between calls, so ~100 requests spread over a semester sits well
inside free-tier limits.

> Prices move, and models get retired. Check the official page before you
> commit to a paid tier:
> [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing) ·
> [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) ·
> [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing) ·
> [DeepSeek](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing) ·
> [Moonshot / Kimi](https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/pricing) ·
> [Zhipu GLM](https://open.bigmodel.cn/pricing) ·
> [Qwen](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/billing-for-model-studio)

Your key is stored in your own config file and is only ever sent to the
provider it belongs to.

## When something can't be done, it says so

Silent skipping is how bugs stay invisible, so every recording that produces
no transcript is named in the week note **with a reason** — and the reason
tells you whether it is worth waiting for:

| What you'll read | Meaning | Will it retry? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| has no captions | genuinely none — e.g. a Zoom cloud recording | no, that's final |
| the platform is rate-limiting us | YouTube blocked our address for now | yes, next sync |
| could not be reached | network or platform hiccup | yes, next sync |
| needs you to sign in to the video platform | Panopto wants one more sign-on | yes, next sync |
| queued for the next sync | held back on purpose, to stay under YouTube's limits | yes, next sync |

---

## What you can change

Courses, download folder, sync interval and the AI provider are all in the app
window. Everything else lives in one `config.yaml`, kept per-user at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\moodle-downloader\` — so replacing or moving the app never
loses your settings.

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `root_dir` | Where course files are saved | `./MoodleFiles` |
| `course_selection` | `manual` (fixed list) or `starred` (follows your Moodle stars) | `manual` |
| `sync_interval_hours` | How often auto-sync runs | `3` |
| `section_patterns` | Regexes matching a section title to a week — add `"module\s*0*{week}\b"` if your unit says "Module 3" | Week / Topic |
| `assignments_folder` | Set to `""` to skip assignments entirely | `Assignments` |
| `weekly_notes` | `false` turns off the weekly summary notes | `true` |
| `transcripts` | `false` turns off caption downloads | `true` |
| `note_formats` | Output formats — `docx`, `txt`, `md` | `docx`, `txt` |
| `max_youtube_per_sync` | YouTube caption fetches allowed **per sync, across all units** | `8` |
| `ai_provider` / `ai_api_key` | Optional AI summaries | off |

> **Why Word and not Markdown?** Most people have never opened a `.md` file,
> and every chatbot accepts `.docx` and `.txt`. Markdown is available but off.

## FAQ

**A browser window opened and asked me to log in.**
Your saved session expired. Log in there and the sync carries on by itself.
Don't close the window.

**My unit says "Module 3" instead of "Week 3".**
Add a pattern to `section_patterns` in `config.yaml`.

**Files went into `_Other/`.**
That section's title matched no week pattern — same fix as above.

**I moved the exe and auto-sync stopped.**
Turn Auto-sync off and on again to re-register the new location.

**Is this allowed?**
It downloads material from units you are enrolled in, through your own login,
for your own study — the same files you could click one at a time.

## Developers · macOS · Linux

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py            # GUI
python run.py sync       # headless sync, for cron or Task Scheduler
```

It drives a real browser through Playwright, using system Edge or Chrome when
available; otherwise run `playwright install chromium` once. macOS and Linux
should work but are not regularly tested.

Build the Windows executable:

```bash
pyinstaller MoodleDownloader.spec --noconfirm
```

`docs/maintainer-notes.md` records the findings behind the crawler, the
caption pipeline and the AI handling — read it before changing any of them.
